# haven-ground-zero

A small system for building work with weight.

Ground Zero is the beginning.
Nothing added.

## Use
Bring work here when it becomes real.

This place exists to:
- protect attention
- remove noise
- keep choices clear

## Weight
Light work drifts.

Weight comes from:
- time
- restraint
- care

## Haven
Haven is orientation.

It answers:
- where you are
- what matters
- what comes next

## Rules
Orientation before expression.  
Signal over spectacle.  
Small moves, done right.

## Ground Zero
A place to return.

When things scatter,  
come back.

## Pace
Move slowly.  
If it feels clever, stop.

Built quietly.
